# Ansible Hands-On Tutorial

## Introduction

This tutorial aims to provide a quick guidance on how to use Ansible for Configuration Management. It describes how to deploy and configure Apache Web Server (or LAMP stack if you want to learn something more advance) on top of pre-provisioned VMs. Please use [this guide](https://github.com/andybondar/ansible-lab__terraform/blob/main/modules/compute/vm/README.md) to deploy the VMs.
